    <h1>Conditional Sentences in English</h1>
    <p>Conditional sentences express situations and their possible results. Let's explore the five main types: Zero, First, Second, Third, and Mixed Conditionals.</p>

    <div class="conditional-type">
        <h2>Zero Conditional</h2>
        <p><strong>Use</strong>: For general truths, scientific facts, and situations that are always true.</p>
        <p><strong>Structure</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If + present simple, present simple</li>
            <li>When/Whenever + present simple, present simple</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Examples</strong>:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>If you heat water to 100°C, it boils.</li>
            <li>When students practice regularly, they improve faster.</li>
            <li>If people don't drink water, they become dehydrated.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="conditional-type">
        <h2>First Conditional</h2>
        <p><strong>Use</strong>: For possible future situations and their likely results.</p>
        <p><strong>Structure</strong>: If + present simple, will/may/might/can + verb</p>
        <p><strong>Examples</strong>:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>If it rains tomorrow, we'll cancel the picnic.</li>
            <li>If you study hard, you will pass the exam.</li>
            <li>If she arrives late, she might miss the opening speech.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="conditional-type">
        <h2>Second Conditional</h2>
        <p><strong>Use</strong>: For hypothetical or unlikely present/future situations.</p>
        <p><strong>Structure</strong>: If + past simple, would/could/might + verb</p>
        <p><strong>Examples</strong>:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>If I won the lottery, I would travel around the world.</li>
            <li>If she spoke Chinese, she could get that job in Shanghai.</li>
            <li>If we had more time, we might visit the museum.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="conditional-type">
        <h2>Third Conditional</h2>
        <p><strong>Use</strong>: For hypothetical situations in the past (things that didn't happen) and their imaginary results.</p>
        <p><strong>Structure</strong>: If + past perfect, would/could/might + have + past participle</p>
        <p><strong>Examples</strong>:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>If I had studied harder, I would have passed the exam.</li>
            <li>If they had left earlier, they wouldn't have missed the train.</li>
            <li>If she had known about the problem, she could have helped you.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="conditional-type">
        <h2>Mixed Conditionals</h2>
        <p><strong>Use</strong>: For mixing time references - typically past condition with present result, or present condition with past result.</p>
        <p><strong>Structure</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Past → Present: If + past perfect, would/could/might + verb</li>
            <li>Present → Past: If + past simple, would/could/might + have + past participle</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Examples</strong>:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>If I had chosen a different career, I would be happier now. (Past condition → Present result)</li>
            <li>If I were more organized, I wouldn't have missed the deadline yesterday. (Present condition → Past result)</li>
            <li>If they hadn't moved to Australia, we would still see them regularly. (Past condition → Present result)</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
