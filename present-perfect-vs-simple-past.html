        <h2>Quick Grammar Explanation</h2>
        <p>We use the <span class="highlight">Present Perfect</span> (have/has + past participle) when describing experiences or actions that connect the past to the present, or when the time is not specified. We also use it for unfinished time periods and recent actions with present relevance. We use the <span class="highlight">Simple Past</span> (verb + ed/irregular form) when describing completed actions at a specific time in the past.</p>
